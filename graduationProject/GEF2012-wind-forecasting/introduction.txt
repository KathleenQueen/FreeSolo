“ train.csv”包含训练数据：

-第一列（“日期”）是时间戳，在随后的列中给出了每小时风电测量的日期和时间。例如，“ 2009070812”是2009年7月8日12:00；

-以下7列（“ wp1”至“ wp7”）收集了7个风电场的标准化风能测量值。对其进行归一化，以便采用0到1之间的值，以使风电场无法被识别。

同时，还为那些可能想要使用它们的人提供了带有解释变量（天气预报）的文件。例如，文件“ windforecasts_wf1”包含风电场1的风向预报。在这些文件中：

-第一列（“日期”）是给出发布预测的日期和时间的时间戳。例如，“ 2009070812”是2009年7月8日12:00；

-第二列（“ hors”）用于预测的提前期。例如，如果“日期” = 2009070812和“hors” = 1，则预测是针对2009年7月8日13:00

-接下来的4列（“ u”，“ v”，“ ws”和“ wd”）是预报本身，前两个是纬向和经向分量，而后两个是相应的风速和风向。

最后，文件“ benchmark.csv”提供了持久性预测方法的示例预测结果（“所见即所得”）。该文件还提供了应严格遵循的结果提交模板。

请注意，“ benchmark.csv”的第一列称为“ id”，并且每一行包含唯一的标识符。其他8列与“ train.csv”相同。 提交结果时，请确保您的文件总共包含9列，格式与“ benchmark.csv”相同。
"train.csv" contains the training data:

- the first column ("date") is a timestamp giving date and time of the hourly wind power measurements in following columns. For instance "2009070812" is for the 8th of July 2009 at 12:00;

- the following 7 columns ("wp1" to "wp7") gather the normalized wind power measurements for the 7 wind farms. They are normalized so as to take values between 0 and 1 in order for the wind farms not to be recognizable.

In parallel, files with explanatory variables (wind forecasts) are also provided for those who may want to use them. For example, the file "windforecasts_wf1" contains the wind forecasts for the wind farm 1. In these files:

- the first column ("date") is a timestamp giving date and time at which the forecasts are issued. For instance "2009070812" is for the 8th of July 2009 at 12:00;

- the second column ("hors") is for the lead time of the forecast. For instance if "date" = 2009070812 and "hors" = 1, the forecast is for the 8th of July 2009 at 13:00

- the following 4 columns ("u", "v", "ws" and "wd") are the forecasts themselves, the first two being the zonal and meridional wind components, while the following two are corresponding wind speed and direction.

Finally, the file "benchmark.csv" provide example forecast results from the persistence forecast method ("what you see is what you get"). This file also gives a template for submission of results that should be strictly followed.

Please notice that the first column of "benchmark.csv" is called "id" and contains unique identifier for each row. The other 8 columns are the same as "train.csv". When submitting the results, please make sure that your file includes totally 9 columns in the same format as "benchmark.csv".
